README File for Library Management System

Overview
The Library Management System is a Python-based program designed to manage library resources efficiently. It allows users to add, search, borrow, and return various types of library items such as books, magazines, and DVDs. The system also tracks due dates and calculates overdue fines for borrowed items.

Key Actions
Add Items: Add books, magazines, or DVDs to the library with unique item IDs.
Search Items: Search the library catalog by title, author, or category.
Check Out Items: Borrow an item by specifying its ID, the borrower's name, and the due date.
Return Items: Return an item and calculate overdue fines if applicable.
Calculate Overdue Fines: Automatically compute fines based on the number of overdue days.

Key Insights
Customizable Structure: The program is designed with extensibility in mind, supporting different types of items through inheritance.
Borrowing System: Tracks the availability of items and ensures that checked-out items cannot be borrowed again until returned.
Fine Management: Encourages timely returns by applying a fine for overdue items.
Search Functionality: Simplifies access to the library catalog with flexible search criteria.
Technologies Used
Python Programming Language:
Core language for implementing the logic.
datetime module for handling dates and overdue calculations.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Classes and inheritance to represent different types of library items and the library itself.
Extensibility:
The program can be easily extended to include additional item types or new features.
Dynamic List Management:
Uses Python lists to manage the library catalog.

How to Use
Initialization: Create a Library object to manage items.
Add Items: Use add_item to add Book, Magazine, or DVD objects to the library.
Search: Use search_item to find items by title, author, or category.
Check Out: Use check_out_item with the item's ID, borrower's name, and due date.
Return: Use return_item with the item's ID to return it and handle fines.
Future Enhancements
User Management: Add support for user accounts and login systems.
GUI Integration: Develop a graphical user interface for enhanced usability.
Cloud Storage: Implement cloud-based storage for scalability.
Email Notifications: Notify users about due dates and overdue items.
