Overview

The project is a simple calculator application developed in Python.
It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The calculator is designed to handle whole numbers ranging from 0 to 50.
The code is compatible with Python 2, ensuring broader accessibility.

Key Activities

User Input: The application prompts the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
Arithmetic Operations: Based on the operator provided, the application performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
Output: The result of the operation is displayed to the user.
Error Handling: The code includes basic checks for specific operations, particularly for addition with zero.

Technology Used

Programming Language: Python (specifically Python 2 for compatibility).
Input Handling: Utilizes input() for user input, with a fallback to raw_input() for Python 2 compatibility.
Arithmetic Logic: Conditional statements (if statements) to determine the operation and calculate results.

Key Insights

The current implementation is limited to whole numbers and lacks support for floating-point arithmetic, which is noted as a future improvement.
The use of extensive conditional statements for each possible input combination can be optimized for better readability and maintainability.
The project serves as a foundational exercise in programming logic, user interaction, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
